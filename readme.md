### Okra PHP

I was working on this as a package within a project as I couldn't find a "good enough" PHP library for Okra, and then I thought "why not make this available for any other person who just like me couldn't find a 'good enough' PHP library to use with Okra".

I love to work with tools and libraries that make my life and DX better. I tried to do that with this. Made it so easy that I can pull it into any project and just get started without having to always crawl through Okra's API documentation. The library itself should be self-explanatory of the API, so it reduces the amount of "back and forth" between API documentation and code.

If you like the work, but the Okra API(s) you need is/are yet to be implemented, please feel free to implement it following the existing pattern. Hopefully, I'll remove this paragraph soon.
